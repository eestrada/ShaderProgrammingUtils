ShaderProgrammingUtils
======================

A repository of shader programming utilities for various shading languages.

The shader_utils.h file for each of the languages should more or less contain the same functions. This should make it fairly simple to write shaders that look similar in different renderers. There will be cases where it doesn't make sense or isn't possible to define certain functions for a given language.
