ShaderProgrammingUtils
======================

A repository of header files with shader programming specific functions for various shading languages.

The header files for each of the languages should more or less contain the same functions. This should make it fairly simple to write shaders in different languages that act similarly in different renderers. There will be cases where it doesn't make sense or isn't possible to define certain functions for a given language so the header files will not be completely the same in all respects.
